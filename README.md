I done this Project in My Summer Internship(APSSDC) . It is done using Python and it is useful in Cyber Security.


The keylogger project aims to develop a software application that records and 
monitors keyboard inputs in real-time. Unlike traditional keyloggers, this project 
incorporates advanced features leveraging artificial intelligence and machine 
learning for enhanced functionality. The key objectives include improving security by 
detecting suspicious activities, enhancing productivity through behavior analysis, 
and ensuring user-friendly configuration options. Compatibility across multiple 
operating systems and robust data security measures are prioritized to offer a 
comprehensive solution. The project seeks to address concerns related to digital 
security and productivity, catering to individuals and organizations seeking advanced 
monitoring tools.
